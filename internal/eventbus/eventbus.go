// Package eventbus: a tiny in-process pub/sub so a connected MCP agent can
// be notified instead of polling. Standalone on purpose — no dependency on
// store/corepipeline/mcpserver, so any of them can import it directly with
// zero cycle risk.
//
// An Event is a low-latency NUDGE, not a second source of truth: it carries
// no message content, just "something changed in this chat, go check" — the
// agent still calls get_pending/get_chat/get_messages (all still gated the
// same way they always were) to find out what actually happened. A dropped
// event is never a correctness problem for that reason; the agent's next
// ordinary poll finds it anyway.

// going to re-sync via get_pending on its next poll regardless.
